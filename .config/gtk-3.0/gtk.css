/*
 * FIX: when using rounded corners, the backdrop of windows are black
 * We can fix this in 2 ways:
 *   - Use corner-radius of picom. However, getting the classes right (which
 *   program should have rounded borders and which doesn't isn't easy. Need
 *   a rule to add all windows except GTK one's to rounded-corners-exclude)
 *   - Remove border-radius from GTK.
 *   Downside here is that the rounded corners on GTK appliations are quite
 *   nice, and it's unclear if all rounded corners should be removed, or only
 *   the window.
 */

/*
 * Allow rounded corners for buttons and tabs, which is most of the elements
 * in a GTK window
 * *:not(button):not(tab) {
 *     border-radius: 0;
 * }
 */

* {
    border-radius: 0;
}
